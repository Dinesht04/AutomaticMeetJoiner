This project provides a simple Node.js script that uses Puppeteer to automatically join Google Meet classes based on a predefined schedule. It's designed to help you never miss a class by handling the joining process for you!

##  Features

* **Automated Class Joining:** Automatically navigates to Google Meet links at scheduled times.
* **Microphone/Camera Control:** Attempts to disable microphone and camera upon joining.
* **Configurable Schedule:** Easily define your daily class timetable in a JSON-like JavaScript file.
* **Browser Profile Support:** Uses a specific Chrome user profile, allowing you to stay logged into your Google account.
* **Automatic Class End:** Closes the browser tab/window once the class end time is reached.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The script operates in the background, continuously checking the current time against your defined `schedule.js` (or `classData.js` if you choose to separate it).

1.  **Time Check:** Every 2 minutes (default, can be adjusted), it checks the current day and time.
2.  **Schedule Lookup:** It looks for a matching class slot in your timetable where `class` is set to `true` and the current time falls within the `start` and `end` times.
3.  **Browser Launch:** If an ongoing class is found, it launches a headless (or non-headless, configurable) Chrome browser instance using Puppeteer.
4.  **Google Meet Navigation:** It navigates to the specified Google Meet link.
5.  **Join Process:** It attempts to:
    * Click on the microphone disable button.
    * Click on the camera disable button.
    * Click the "Join Now" button.
6.  **Class End:** Once the class's `end` time is reached, the browser tab/window automatically closes.
7.  **Prevents Multiple Joins:** The `classOnGoing` flag ensures that the script doesn't try to open multiple browser instances for the same ongoing class.

##  Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the auto-joiner on your machine.

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed (LTS version recommended). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
* **Google Chrome:** Puppeteer interacts with Google Chrome, so ensure it's installed on your system. The script currently points to a Windows default path, but you can adjust `executablePath` if needed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dinesht04/AutomaticMeetJoiner.git
    
    cd AutomaticMeetJoiner
    ```
    (Replace `your-username/your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub repository details.)

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This will install `puppeteer` and `nodemon` (for automatic restarts during development).

### Configuration

The core of this project is your class schedule.

1.  **Create your `classData.js` (or `schedule.js`) file:**
    You'll need to create a file (e.g., `classData.js` in the root of your project) that exports your class schedule as a JavaScript object.

    **Example `classData.js` structure:**

    ```javascript
    export const schedule = {
        "monday": {
            "slot1": {
                "class": false, // Set to true if there's a class
                "start": "08:30:00",
                "end": "10:00:00"
            },
            "slot2": {
                "class": true,
                "start": "10:05:00",
                "end": "11:35:00",
                "link": "[https://meet.google.com/yrx-nrks-bpe](https://meet.google.com/yrx-nrks-bpe)" // Your Google Meet link
            },
            // ... more slots for Monday
        },
        "tuesday": {
            "slot1": {
                "class": true,
                "start": "08:30:00",
                "end": "10:00:00",
                "link": "[https://meet.google.com/xxo-ejnx-iqk](https://meet.google.com/xxo-ejnx-iqk)"
            },
            // ... more slots for Tuesday
        },
        // ... repeat for "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday", "sunday"
    };
    ```

    * **Day Names:** Use lowercase full day names (e.g., `"monday"`, `"tuesday"`).
    * **Slot Names:** You can name your slots anything (e.g., `"slot1"`, `"morningClass"`).
    * **`class: true/false`:** Set to `true` if there's a class in that slot, `false` otherwise.
    * **`start` and `end`:** Use **24-hour format (HH:MM:SS)**. These define the window during which the script will attempt to join.
    * **`link`:** The full Google Meet link for that specific class. **Only required if `class` is `true`.**

2.  **Locate your Chrome `Profile 2` (or desired profile) `User Data` directory:**
    Puppeteer uses Chrome profiles to remember logins and settings.
    * **Windows:** Typically `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\`
    * **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/`
    * **Linux:** `~/.config/google-chrome/`

    **Identify your profile folder:** Inside the `User Data` directory, you'll find folders like `Default`, `Profile 1`, `Profile 2`, etc. If you want to use "Profile 2" as specified in the code, ensure that folder exists and contains your logged-in Google account. If you use a different profile, update `"--profile-directory=Profile 2"` in `index.js` accordingly.

3.  **Adjust `executablePath` (if needed):**
    In `index.js`, the `executablePath` for Chrome is set to a Windows default. If you're on a different OS or your Chrome is installed in a custom location, **you must update this path**:

    ```javascript
    const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
      headless: false, // Set to true for background execution without a visible browser
      executablePath:
        "C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe", // <--- UPDATE THIS PATH
      userDataDir: "./User Data/", // Relative path within your project or full path
      args: [
        "--profile-directory=Profile 2", // <--- UPDATE IF USING A DIFFERENT PROFILE
        "--no-sandbox",
        "--disable-setuid-sandbox",
      ],
    });
    ```
    * **`headless: false`:** This setting means you'll see a Chrome window pop up and navigate to the meeting. Change to `true` if you want it to run entirely in the background without a visible browser window (useful for servers or less intrusive operation).
    * **`userDataDir`:** This points to where your Chrome profile data is stored. The provided `"./User Data/"` suggests it will look for a `User Data` folder *relative to your project's root*. It's often safer to use an absolute path to your actual Chrome `User Data` directory.

### Running the Script



1.  **To Start the Program:**
    You can run it directly with:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
    

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

* **Google Meet UI Changes:** Google Meet's interface might change over time, which could break the selectors (`#yDmH0d > ...`) used to find buttons. If the script stops working, you might need to update these selectors by inspecting the Google Meet page's HTML in your browser's developer tools.
* **Microphone/Camera Permissions:** When Puppeteer first launches Chrome with your profile, Google Meet might ask for microphone and camera permissions. You'll need to grant these manually once in the launched browser window.
* **Time Zones:** The script uses your system's local time. Ensure your system's time zone is correctly configured.
* **Internet Connection:** A stable internet connection is required for the script to function correctly.
